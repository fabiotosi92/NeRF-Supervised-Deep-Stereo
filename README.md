**Contributions:** 

* Introducing a novel paradigm for **collecting** and **generating stereo training data** using **neural rendering** and <ins>a collection of user-captured image sequences</ins>. Our methodology revolutionizes stereo network training by leveraging readily available user-captured images, **eliminating the need for synthetic datasets, ground-truth depth, or even real stereo pairs**!

* A **NeRF-Supervised (NS) training protocol** that combines rendered image triplets and depth maps to address occlusions and enhance fine details. 

* **State-of-the art, zero-shot generalization** results on challenging stereo datasets, without exploiting any ground-truth or real stereo pair.

## Dataset

We collect a total of 270 high-resolution (8Mpx) scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments using **standard camera-equipped smartphones**. For each scene, we focus on a/some specific object(s) and acquire 100 images from different viewpoints, ensuring that the scenery is completely static. The acquisition protocol involves a set of either front-facing or 360° views.

**Examples of scenes in our dataset.** Here we report individual examples derived from 30 different scenes that comprise our dataset.

[Download here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fkSneuLK3f3yW4VrFSsAsJEZ-Jys90l6)

After downloading the dataset from the provided link, you will find two folders:

1. 📂 **raw_data_v1**: This folder contains zip files for each of the 270 scenes. Inside each zip file, you will find raw RGB images at high-resolution captured using our smartphones, which were later used to generate stereo pairs using NeRF. It also includes the camera poses obtained through COLMAP.

2. 📂**stereo_dataset_v1**: In this folder, you will find zip files for each of the 270 scenes. Inside each zip file, you will find rendered stereo pairs generated by NeRF, along with corresponding disparity maps and AO maps. The disparity maps and AO maps are saved as 16-bit images. To obtain the actual disparity values, please divide the disparity map values by a factor of 64. Similarly, divide the AO map values by a factor of 65536. Please note that due to space constraints, we are providing the stereo images at 0.5Mpx only, used to train the stereo models released.


## Pretrained Models

Here, you can download the weights of **RAFT-Stereo** and **PSMNet** architectures. These models were trained from scratch on rendered triplets of our real-world dataset using our NeRF-Supervised training loss.

To use these weights, please follow these steps:

1. Create a folder named `weights` in the project directory.
2. Download the weights of the respective models:

If you haven't downloaded the pretrained models yet, you can find the download links in the **Pretrained Models** section above.

## Training NeRF

To train a NeRF model starting from a scene captured with a single camera, you can utilize various NeRF implementations available. One such implementation that we have used in our experiments is [Instant-NGP](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp). Instant-NGP offers high accuracy and fast training times, making it suitable for training multiple NeRF models and rendering thousands of images quickly.

Please refer to the Instant-NGP repository and follow their instructions for training NeRF models. While we used Instant-NGP in our experiments, you are free to choose any other NeRF implementation that suits your needs.

In addition, we provide a code snippet named `generate_stereo_pair_matrix.py` in the `code_snippets` folder. This code is used to generate stereo pairs from a **transform.json** file, which is typically used in Instant-NGP. You can use this code to facilitate the creation of stereo pairs for your NeRF training. Feel free to customize and adapt it according to your specific requirements.


## Qualitative Results

In this section, we present illustrative examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.

**Examples of Rendered Images and Depth from NeRF.** We show examples on a scene of our dataset. In each case, the leftmost and rightmost columns show the rendered left and right images in a triplet, respectively. These images were obtained using small, medium, and large baselines, as indicated by the red, green, and blue lines. The center column, from top to bottom, shows the center image in the triplet, its corresponding rendered disparity map, and ambient occlusion map. Here, we adopt the Instant-NGP framework to render images.
